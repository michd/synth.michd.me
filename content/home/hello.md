Hello! I'm Mich, and I rather like synthesizers, especially building my own. I've been doing a lot of that since early 2016, so I thought it would make sense to dedicate a <abbr title="Well, here's hoping it becomes not so little in the end.">little</abbr> site to it.

First of, I want to pay my respects to &dagger;Ray Wilson of [Music From Outer Space](http://www.musicfromouterspace.com/). While I had a vague desire to start building a synthesizer, Ray's enthusiasm in [Make: Analog synthesizers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Make-Analog-Synthesizers-Ray-Wilson-ebook/dp/B00D3VEKH2) and <abbr title="Music From Outer Space">MFOS</abbr> really rubbed off on me. In his words: _Keep imagining, keep inventing, stay ingenious!_

On this site I will describe in detail how I've built synthesizer modules, as well as lessons I learn along the way, techniques I figure out, and so on. I'll try to keep it somewhat organized, and have the rest of this homepage serve as an index of all the content on the site.
